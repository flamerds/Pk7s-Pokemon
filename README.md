# PKDB

Pokemon database for the stream http://twitch.tv/gr33nd3v1l

[Pokemon detail list is on Wiki](https://github.com/gr33nd3v1l/PKDB/wiki)

♥ Automated giveaway stream, Use !gts, !details. Pokémon change every day at midnight, unless otherwise specified. I try to stick to the !dailypoll timer. Clock and more info is on screen, read it. ♥

The giveaway pokémon are always 91-100 unless they can evolve, or absolutely have to be lower. Keep in mind you don't have to level lock, or nickname the pokémon.

Deposit NOSEPASS (you can track Nosepass trades on cam, my 3ds is tagged: MOON) or TRUBBISH (my 3ds: SUN) in GTS asking for any of the giveaway !pokémon, you can visit the !details wiki for more info.

Current, Suggested, Tomorrow and TODO lists, and pokemon details can be found here: http://bit.ly/greenieGIT - Submit new ideas under Issues tab, more details in Wiki, Ctrl+F is your friend!

___SONGS___
You can request songs with !sr KEYWORDS OF SONG (e.g. !sr eminem lose yourself)
It costs 400 spots to request a song for a regular user! If it doesn't work, you probably don't have enough.

# RULES

I only ask of you that if you use any of my files from this repository, you give me proper credit. These pokémon were created and collected by me. It's a lot of hard work, so the least you can do is just give me a proper mention ❤
